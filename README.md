# Sapien

An intelligent AI firewall and companion that helps you navigate the increasingly AI-dominated digital landscape by distinguishing between human and AI interactions across multiple communication platforms.

## Purpose

Sapien acts as your personal gatekeeper in social and professional networks, ensuring you spend your time and attention on genuine human connections. As AI agents become more prevalent across social media and messaging platforms, Sapien helps you maintain authentic human interactions by:

- **Multi-Platform Management**: Monitors interactions across X (Twitter), WhatsApp, Telegram, Zangi, Viber, and other platforms
- **AI Detection**: Analyzes communication patterns to distinguish between human and AI contacts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns probability scores indicating the likelihood that a contact is human
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Filters social media interactions so you only engage with verified humans
- **Contact Management**: Maintains a database of contacts with their human-likelihood scores
- **Privacy First**: All analysis happens on your infrastructure, keeping your data private

## Problem Statement

The digital world is increasingly populated by AI agents, bots, and automated systems posing as humans. These entities consume attention, create noise in social feeds, and make it difficult to maintain meaningful human connections. Sapien solves this by providing an intelligent layer that identifies and filters AI interactions, allowing you to focus on what matters: genuine human relationships.
